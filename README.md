# Text-Classifier

Thanks to Weng-Keen Wong and his advisor Andrew Moore for sharing the data.

Implement the Naive Bayes Classifier (with Laplace Smoothing)
This classifier will be used to classify fortune
cookie messages into two classes: messages that predict what will happen in the future (class
1) and messages that just contain a wise saying (class 0).

The vocabulary consists of the set of all the words that are in the
training data with stop words removed (stop words are common, uninformative words such as
\a" and \the" that are listed in the file stoplist.txt). The vocabulary will now be the features
of your training data. Keep the vocabulary in alphabetical order to help you with debugging.

Implement the Naive Bayes Classifier (with Laplace Smoothing) and run it on the training
data. Compute the training and testing accuracy.
